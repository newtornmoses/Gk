      This Privacy Policy explains gecko’s data collection practices that apply
      toward (i) our business’ Services consumers, whether they are publishers,
      advertisers or any other type of business partners (Customer/s) and (ii)
      the data practices relating to visitors of the Site and our Customer’s
      websites and/or products (End User/s); Customers and End Users will be
      jointly be referred to as Users. Lastly, the Privacy Policy refers to
      general provisions, which are applicable to both Customers and Users.
      Capitalized terms will have the meaning given in the gecko Terms or here,
      in this Privacy Policy. When we use the term Personal Information we mean
      information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other
      information, to personally identify an individual (natural person), such
      as a first and last name, an email address, phone number, a home or other
      physical address, and other contact information. In some jurisdictions and
      given the specific use we make with the information, IP address that your
      Internet service provider allocates for your device, may also be
      considered as Personal Information (in the European Union for example). In
      which case, we will be treating the information as personal in all
      handling and safeguarding aspects, however, gecko does not make any use of
      such information for identification or personalization purposes and we do
      not combine such data with another in an attempt to identify you.</span

    constant monitoring, we use third party processing and serving services that
    implement various information security standards and certifications (at rest
    and transmission), and we monitor and filter access to data when it comes to
    personnel in our organization. Such systems and procedures reduce the risk
    of security breaches, but they do not provide absolute security, as there is
    no such thing when it comes to the world- wide network. Therefore, we cannot
    guarantee that the Services and our servers are immune to unauthorized
    access to the information stored therein and to other information security
    risks. If you have any questions about our security and safeguards efforts,
